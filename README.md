# Screen Locker for OSX

## What can I do?

The fact is:

I am just a application to call screen saver.

But with some options of OSX “System Preferences", I can lock the screen. :)

## Installation:

Clone me to anywhere:

`git clone https://github.com/ITXiaoPang/OSX_Screen_Locker.git`

------

1.Copy me to the /Applications

``` shell
cd OSX_Screen_Locker
cp -a ScreenSaver.app /Applications/
```

2.Open the “System Preferences”->”Security & Privacy”->”General”->Pitch on “Require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins”.

3.Now you can lock your screen with type “ScreenSaver” in the Spotlight.

4.[Optional]Use the app [Manico](http://manico.im/) to open me with shortcuts like "Alt + L”.

## Enjoy it.
